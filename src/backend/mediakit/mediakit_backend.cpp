/* mediakit_backend.cpp — the RenkuOS Media Kit implementation of audio_backend.h.
 *
 * Kasen becomes one media node, "Kasen", that other nodes connect to and
 * that the user patches in Cortex. It is a BBufferProducer and a
 * BBufferConsumer driven by its own BMediaEventLooper, in the way
 * SoundPlayNode (src/kits/media/SoundPlayNode.cpp) drives BSoundPlayer:
 * one event per period, scheduled on the time source, each running one
 * engine cycle and sending one buffer to every connected output.
 *
 * Engine ports and Media Kit connections. The engine was written for JACK:
 * mono ports that it reads and writes each cycle, connected by name. Here a
 * port is a mono buffer owned by the backend, and media connections carry
 * several channels each.
 *  - Outputs: as with JACK, every output port is a jack of its own: out_N
 *    is the mono jack "Out N", and "metronome" the mono jack "Metronome".
 *    out_1/out_2 also make the stereo jack "Master" (for the system mixer,
 *    when there is no card to play on). A media output connects to exactly
 *    one input, so every
 *    jack always offers one more free output: the same signal can feed the
 *    system mixer and a hardware input at once.
 *  - Inputs: as with JACK, every capture port is a jack of its own: in_N is
 *    "In N" (in_NR, a stereo track's right side, "In NR"). Each always
 *    offers a free jack, and each connection made on it (from a hardware
 *    capture output, or anything patched in a patchbay) becomes an input
 *    with its own FIFO that feeds that port; several add up, as in JACK. A
 *    connection with more channels than one feeds the port the one
 *    connect() chose, or, made in a patchbay, left and right to in_N and
 *    in_NR (a stereo track) or all of them mixed down. A source at another
 *    rate (an app playing a 44.1 kHz file) is converted as it arrives, and
 *    one on another clock is steered to ours, as PipeWire does; in JACK
 *    every client runs at the server's rate, and here only the system mixer
 *    converted. The track's input list offers apps' outputs as well as
 *    hardware; an app's output goes to one place at a time, so choosing it
 *    takes it from the system mixer, and undoing that gives it back.
 *    The engine's connect(source, in_N) makes that connection on in_N's
 *    jack (from another output of the same name when the first is in use,
 *    as multi_audio offers), and disconnect undoes it, which is what
 *    jack_connect and jack_disconnect do. Only an output that can come in
 *    once and already does is read where it comes in (a route).
 *  - Out 1/Out 2 (and the Metronome) connect to the playback 1/2 jacks of
 *    the card that runs the clock when the node starts, as JACK's
 *    system:playback_1/2, and the engine's get_ports(physical playback)
 *    lists that card's mono jacks. Only without such a card does the Master
 *    go to the system mixer instead.
 *
 * Clock. The rate and period are those of the card that runs the system
 * time source (the default output), read from its playback jacks' format
 * (multi_audio only accepts its driver's own rate and buffer length), or
 * else of the system mixer's output; the node is slaved to the system time
 * source. An output connection at another rate or buffer length, or to a
 * consumer on another time source, is refused.
 *
 * Period changes (multi_audio's "Buffer size" setting, changed while
 * running). Neither the system mixer nor multi_audio accepts ChangeFormat()
 * from a producer, and the Media Kit sends no format-change notice, so:
 *  - A hardware input that Kasen feeds directly asks for its new length
 *    itself (FormatChangeRequested); it is accepted when every other output
 *    goes to that same device or to the system mixer.
 *  - The system mixer, when its output changes, tells its producers of its
 *    new latency (LatencyChanged). The roster watcher then reads the mixer's
 *    output format, and the node follows its period when all its outputs go
 *    to the mixer. The mixer reads each buffer's size_used, but sizes its
 *    ring for an input from the length in the connection's format (three
 *    of them, or two output buffers); a longer buffer overruns it, and it
 *    crashed the mixer in testing. So a consumer that leaves the length
 *    open (the mixer does) is given the longest period we may change to,
 *    and every buffer sent is one period, within it.
 * The engine's mix buffers, the port buffers and the input FIFOs are sized
 * for the longest period up front (JD_MAX_PERIOD, or the period at open if
 * longer), so a change allocates nothing but the new buffer groups, as a
 * connection does. A change during a take moves the rest of the take: the
 * device restarts its streams and the capture latency changes with it.
 *
 * Threads.
 *  - The node's control thread (BMediaEventLooper, B_URGENT_PRIORITY, the
 *    looper default, so the system mixer and multi_audio at
 *    B_REAL_TIME_PRIORITY always preempt it) runs the engine cycle, receives
 *    capture buffers, and handles every connection hook. Those all run on
 *    one thread, so the cycle never races a connection change.
 *  - The engine's non-RT caller (the main window) registers ports, routes
 *    capture channels and asks for connections. Port slots and routes are
 *    published with atomics. Port buffers are never freed while the client
 *    is open (a slot is reused), so the cycle can always read a slot it saw.
 *    The input table is guarded by fInputLock for that caller.
 *  - A small looper watches the roster and turns its notifications into the
 *    engine's ports/connections/shutdown callbacks.
 *
 * MIDI (Midi Kit 2, patched in PatchBay; the Media Kit carries no MIDI).
 *  - Each engine MIDI port is an endpoint registered with the MIDI roster:
 *    an input port a BMidiLocalConsumer, an output port a BMidiLocalProducer,
 *    named "Kasen MIDI in N", "Kasen MIDI out N", "Kasen control in".
 *    The engine's connect(source, port) connects another endpoint by name.
 *  - In: a consumer's own thread (the Midi Kit's, real-time priority) puts
 *    each event and its time into a lock-free ring. The cycle that plays at
 *    performance time P takes the events whose time falls in one period
 *    ending at P's real time less the event and scheduling latency (when the
 *    cycle nominally runs), each at its offset in that window. So every event
 *    sounds the same fixed delay after it arrived, without jitter; that delay
 *    is the MIDI ports' capture latency.
 *  - Out: the cycle stamps each event with the real time its frame plays and
 *    puts it in the port's ring; a writer thread sprays it (SprayData
 *    allocates and locks). midi_server's hardware consumers wait for that
 *    time before writing to the device, so MIDI out lines up with the audio.
 *  - Endpoints and rings are made when a port slot is first registered as
 *    MIDI and kept until close, like port buffers; unregistering disconnects
 *    an endpoint and takes it off the roster.
 *
 * Allocation: buffers and FIFOs are allocated when a port is registered or a
 * connection is made (the Media Kit runs connection hooks on the control
 * thread, as for every node), and buffer groups also when the period
 * changes; never per cycle. Buffer requests do not wait.
 *
 * Other hosts. Nothing here is Kasen's engine, so another program can build
 * this file in and drive it through the same table (VST3-renku's vst3host
 * does). jackdaw_mediakit_set_node_name renames the node and its MIDI
 * endpoints, open's client name sets the ports' full-name prefix, and the
 * Metronome jack is connected to the mixer only if a "metronome" port is
 * registered before activate. */
