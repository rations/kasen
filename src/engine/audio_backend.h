/* audio_backend.h — the engine's view of the audio and MIDI system.
 *
 * The engine (jackdaw-engine.c) talks to the audio system only through this
 * table, so the same engine runs on JACK or on another backend. The calls
 * mirror the subset of the JACK client API the engine was written against:
 * one client with named mono audio ports and MIDI ports, a process callback
 * that is handed port buffers each cycle, and connections between ports named
 * by string. A backend that is not JACK presents its own endpoints the same way.
 *
 * Threading: open, activate, close, port_register/unregister, port_name,
 * port_capture_latency, get_ports, connect and disconnect are non-RT and are
 * called from the engine's single non-RT caller (see jackdaw-engine.h).
 * port_buffer and the midi_* calls are RT and are called only from the
 * process callback's thread, as jack_port_get_buffer requires. The callbacks
 * in JdBackendCallbacks follow the JACK rules: process and buffer_size may run
 * on the RT thread; the others run on notification threads and must only post.
 *
 * Plain C, no glib, so a backend can be built as a separate add-on. */
