/* rt_ringbuffer.h — lock-free single-producer / single-consumer byte ring.
 *
 * A drop-in for the subset of <jack/ringbuffer.h> Kasen uses: same calls,
 * same arguments, same capacity rule (the size is rounded up to a power of
 * two and one byte of it is never filled), same "reset is not thread safe".
 * One deliberate difference: read_advance is clamped to what is readable, so
 * skipping a record can never move the reader past the writer.
 *
 * WHY NOT jack_ringbuffer_*. The engine's rings (clip playback, recording,
 * MIDI capture, render tap, preview and control queues) are not JACK objects,
 * and the engine is meant to run on more than one audio backend: tying them
 * to libjack would make libjack a dependency of every backend. Owning the
 * ring also makes the memory ordering a property of Kasen rather than of
 * the libjack build in use: some libjacks do not order the data copy against
 * the index update, which is harmless on x86 but lets a weakly ordered CPU
 * read stale bytes.
 *
 * Ordering: each index is written only by its own side, with a release store
 * after the copy; the other side reads it with an acquire load before touching
 * the bytes. That covers both hazards — reading bytes not yet written, and
 * overwriting bytes not yet read.
 *
 * RT-safe: read, peek, read_advance, read_space, write and write_space do no
 * allocation, locking or system calls. create, free and mlock are not RT. */
